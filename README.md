# GitHub & Git Assignment
## What I Learned from the Video
#gitadd
Moves your changes into the staging area so Git knows what you want to include in the next save point.

#git commit
Creates a snapshot of the staged changes with a message, basically saving your progress permanently in history.


#Branching 
Lets you work on new features or experiments in a separate version without messing up the main code, then merge later.
